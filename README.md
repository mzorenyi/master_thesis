This repository contains the code I used in my Master's Thesis. While the code is mainly written in R, the neural networks are run in Python.
The link between R and Python is created using the package reticulate. 
The files contain paths to where outputs such as the results or plots should be saved to, however this can be easily adjusted by changing the variable "main_path". 
For the empirical part (files containing "market") data from Bloomberg was used, which I presume I can't share on Github. Here the code expects a .xlsx file as input.
